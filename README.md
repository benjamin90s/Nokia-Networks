Problem Statement:

Nokia must map its internal DFSEC requirements with various national laws, including India's ITSAR, China's CSL, and the UK's TSR. Currently, this mapping process is manual, but the frequent introduction of new laws every few months has made manual mapping increasingly difficult. As a result, automating this mapping process has become necessary, and we are leveraging NLP techniques to achieve this automation.

Note: Due to the proprietary nature of the data, it cannot be shared as it belongs to Nokia.
